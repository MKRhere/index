# MKRhere/index

This repository is meant to contain a master list of everything I'm working on publicly. It's mostly meant as a private reference, but feel free to browse through.

> ðŸ’¥ List is not complete! I'm still compiling.

## Design

Humanist Min is a design language/framework being developed (albeit very slowly) by us at FeathersDesign.

## Programming

## Science

#### [â†’ CommonUnits](https://github.com/commonunits/draft)
SI was a great system, but they left too many inconsistencies. CommonUnits is a thought experiment to see if we can normalize everything, including time, to base 10.

## Other lists
> Some other lists like this that I've compiled.

#### [â†’ MKRhere/r](https://github.com/MKRhere/r)

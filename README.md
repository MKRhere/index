# MKRhere/index

This repository is meant to contain a master list of everything I'm working on publicly. It's mostly meant as a private reference, but feel free to browse through.

> 💥 List is not complete! I'm still compiling.

## Programming

#### [→ CommonUnits](https://github.com/commonunits/draft)
SI was a great system, but they left too many inconsistencies. CommonUnits is a thought experiment to see if we can normalize everything, including time, to base 10.

## Other lists

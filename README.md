# MKRhere/index

This repository is meant to contain a master list of everything I'm working on publicly. It's mostly meant as a private reference, but feel free to browse through.

> ðŸ’¥ List is not complete! I'm still compiling.

## Design
> Those who know me know that I'm primarily a designer. I originally studied to be an Architect at Ooty, India.

#### [â†’ Humanist Min](https://github.com/feathersdesign/HumanistMin)
Humanist Min is a design language/framework being developed (albeit very slowly) by us at FeathersDesign.

#### [â†’ MKRhere/Stuff](https://github.com/MKRhere/Stuff)
I'll post some design templates and stuff in here. Unlicensed and Public Domain.

## Programming Projects
> I grew up with computers. My first was a Pentium 4 PC in 2002. Looking back, I wish I'd learnt more programming, but now here I am.

#### [â†’ up-serve](https://github.com/codefeathers/up-serve)
> `up-serve` is a command line application that creates nginx server blocks quickly with a single command.

#### [â†’ WordBox](https://github.com/codefeathers/WordBox)
> `WordBox` is a modern development and deployment environment for WordPress and PHP, written in Node. It runs an express server in place of Apache.

#### [â†’ Teza](https://github.com/outfocusonline/teza-api)
> This is a very interesting project. `Teza` is a dynamic API server. It provides endpoints that creates and destroys other endpoints. In a way this is like a headless-headless-CMS. You can connect a real headless CMS to it, or any other content source, like a Telegram bot.

## Science
> I've always loved science whether or not I have been an active participant.

#### [â†’ CommonUnits](https://github.com/commonunits/draft)
SI was a great system, but they left too many inconsistencies. CommonUnits is a thought experiment to see if we can normalize everything, including time, to base 10.

## Other lists
> Some other lists like this that I've compiled.

#### [â†’ MKRhere/r](https://github.com/MKRhere/r)
`/r` is a recommended software stack repo. It lists some of the software and tools I use on daily basis.
